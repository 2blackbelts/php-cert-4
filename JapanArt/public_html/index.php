<h2>This month's featured print</h2>
<p><strong>"Under The Wave Off Kanagawa"</strong> by Hokusai</p>
<p>The most famous of the series "36 Views of Mount Fuji" by Katsushika Hokusai (b. 1760).  
	Also known as "The Great Wave", this iconic woodblock image is said to have inspired Debussy’s La Mer (The Sea) and Rilke’s Der Berg (The Mountain).  
	Our print of this famous work faithfully reproduces the original colours.
